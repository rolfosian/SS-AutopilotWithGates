# Autopilot With Gates
## QoL mod for Starsector integrating the gates into the vanilla autopilot

Adds an ability that when toggled sets the autopilot course target to the nearest (scanned) gate to the fleet and links to the scanned gate nearest to the ultimate autopilot course target.

To remove the ability from a save and safely disable the mod, use console command `removeapwg` and restart the game without the mod enabled.
